ABSTRACT


Traditional call-graph construction algorithms conflate the computation of possible runtime types with the actual resolution of
(virtual) calls. This tangled design impedes supporting complex language features and APIs and making systematic trade-offs between
precision, soundness, and scalability. It also impedes implementation of precise downstream analyses that rely on type information.
To address the problem, we propose Unimocg, a modular architecture for call-graph construction that decouples the computation
of type information from resolving calls. Due to its modular design, Unimocg can combine a wide range of different call-graph
algorithms with algorithm-agnostic modules to support individual
language features. Moreover, these modules operate at the same
precision as the chosen call-graph algorithm with no further effort.
Additionally, Unimocg allows other analyses to easily reuse type
information from the call-graph construction at full precision.
We demonstrate how Unimocg enables a framework of call-graph
algorithms with different precision, soundness, and scalability tradeoffs from reusable modules. Unimocg currently supports ten callgraph algorithms from vastly different families, such as CHA, RTA,
XTA, and 푘 - 푙 -CFA. These algorithms show consistent soundness
without sacrificing precision or performance. We also show how
an immutability analysis is improved using Unimocg.

1 INTRODUCTION


Sound and precise call graphs are a prerequisite for inter-procedural
static analysis. Over the past decades, dozens of call-graph algorithms for object-oriented programming languages have been proposed [ 1, 4, 9, 24, 29 ]. However, their implementations have inconsistent support for crucial language features, e.g., reflection, serialization, or threads—they often support these features unsoundly,
or not at all [16, 17, 26].

Table 1 shows the state of affairs for the WALA [ 11 ] and Soot [ 30 ]
frameworks. We generated the table by reproducing Reif et al.’s [ 16 ]
study of soundness [1] of JVM-language call-graph algorithms. We
used the current version of their benchmark [2] —a suite of manu
ally annotated tests—and current versions of WALA (1.5.7) and
Soot (4.4.1) for the call-graph algorithms Class-Hierarchy Analysis
(CHA) [ 4 ], Rapid-Type Analysis (RTA) [ 1 ], Control-Flow Analysis
(CFA) [24], and Soot’s default configuration of SPARK [13].
While the exact numbers have changed, the overall picture stays
the same as reported by Reif et al. [ 16 ]: Language feature support
varies significantly not only across frameworks but even across
algorithms within the same framework. In general, more precise
call-graph algorithms become less sound. All call-graph algorithms
of WALA and Soot fail to soundly analyze about half of the test
cases. For some features, call-graph algorithms even fail all test


1 None of these call-graph algorithms are sound in the mathematical sense. In this
paper, we refer to the term soundness as a lower number of missing edges in call graphs.
This is in line with related work [16, 26].

cases, an indication that they may not support the feature explicitly.
In some cases, less precise call-graph algorithms like CHA and RTA
pass tests due to excessive imprecision rather than to actual feature
support. Surprisingly, WALA’s CHA is not only less precise but
apparently also less sound than WALA’s RTA. The inconsistent
support of language features makes it difficult for users to systematically choose an appropriate call-graph algorithm. One has to
know in detail which language features each algorithm supports
soundly and cannot decide based on precision and performance
alone. This also makes it difficult for researchers to compare callgraph algorithms and implementations in terms of precision and
performance.
In this paper, we analyze reasons for this observed inconsistency
and propose a solution to the problem. In short, the problem is that
different call-graph algorithms handle language features in specific
ways by making specific use of different kinds of information they
have access to. For example, a CFA algorithm can soundly handle
more reflection calls because it has access to pointer information.
CHA and RTA handle reflection differently because they do not
have access to pointer information. As a result, code that handles
call resolution for individual language features is coupled to specific call-graph algorithms, which makes it difficult to reuse that
code across different call-graph algorithms. Developers wanting to
support new language features have to duplicate code to support
dissimilar algorithms. Thus, the available resources and priorities
of developers of a certain framework determine which features are
supported by which algorithm; maintenance is also complicated as
features evolve.

The work presented in this paper demonstrates that it is possible
to implement a variety of call-graph algorithms with consistent
handling of language features. Specifically, we propose Unimocg
(UNIfied MOdular Call Graphs), a novel architecture for modular
implementation of call-graph algorithms that decouples the implementation of the following concerns: (1) computation of type
information, (2) interpretation of type information, (3) resolution

of calls, and (4) analyses that depend on type information. Fig. 1
overviews the components that handle these concerns in Unimocg
and their relations.

Type producers compute information about the runtime types of
variables and fields. Type iterators interpret this type information
and make it available to call resolvers and type consumers—keeping
them decoupled from type producers. Call resolvers resolve method
calls or calls of language features such as reflection, serialization, or
threads. They query a type iterator for type information about call
receivers or arguments of reflective calls; in turn, the information
about resolved method calls is used by type producers. Type consumers are static analyses that depend on type information but do
not contribute to call-graph construction. Without type iterators,
type consumers would have to rely on imprecise type information,
e.g., provided by static types, to avoid dependence on a specific
call-graph algorithm. For instance, the immutability analysis by
Roth et al. [ 20 ] uses imprecise type information from static types
and the class hierarchy.
Unimocg’s modular architecture enables deriving call graphs
with consistent coverage of language features and hence soundness
by reusing and combining type producers, type iterator, and call
resolvers in a plug-n-play manner. We show that Unimocg enables
a wide range of call-graph algorithms to share the same support
for language features such as reflection and serialization, thus ensuring consistent soundness, by implementing ten algorithms from
different families: CHA [ 4 ], RTA [ 1 ], the XTA family with MTA,
FTA, and CTA [ 29 ], as well as 푘 - 푙 -CFA-based algorithms 0-CFA,
0-1-CFA, 1-0-CFA, and 1-1-CFA [9].
Type consumers also benefit from the modular architecture by
reusing precise type information computed for call-graph construction. To showcase this, we reimplemented the immutability analysis
by Roth et al. [ 20 ] as a type consumer in Unimocg. Unimocg’s separation of call-graph construction from the computation of type
information ensures consistent and improved precision of the immutability analysis when combined with more precise call graphs.
Unimocg benefits both users and developers of static analyses
(call-graph and other analyses). Users can rely on consistent soundness and can systematically choose appropriate algorithms for their

respective applications considering only their intuition about the
relative precision and performance of different algorithms. Analysis
developers, on the other hand, can easily extend Unimocg to support new language features across all available algorithms or add
new call-graph and/or other analysis algorithms while retaining all
available feature support.
As our evaluation shows, Unimocg’s benefits do not come at the
cost of precision or performance compared to state-of-the-art static
analysis frameworks.
In summary, we make the following contributions:

  - We analyze the reasons for inconsistent soundness in stateof-the-art call-graph algorithms (Section 2)

  - We propose Unimocg, a novel architecture for implementing
call-graph analyses modularly (Section 3). Unimocg allows
deriving various call graphs with consistent soundness. In
particular, we show how resolution of features like reflection
can be decoupled from the call-graph algorithm.

  - We discuss how Unimocg benefits analyses that depend on
type information but do not participate in call-graph construction (Section 3.5).

  - We use Unimocg to implement families of different call
graphs and measure soundness, precision, and performance
compared to the state of the art and evaluate their impact
on a state-of-the-art immutability analysis (Section 4).

The current implementation of Unimocg focuses on call-graph
construction for JVM languages, but the addressed problems and
the Unimocg architecture are language agnostic.


2 PROBLEM STATEMENT


We analyze two problems with existing call-graph algorithms responsible for the observed soundness inconsistency (Table 1).


Problem 1: Coupling of Call Resolution of Language Features to
Base Call-Graph Algorithms. Modern programming languages have
many features, which are difficult to analyze. Three such Java features are reflection, (de)serialization, and threads. Reflection [ 12 ]
dynamically instantiates classes and calls methods based on runtime strings and types. To resolve reflective calls, a call-graph analysis needs to statically determine strings for the class and method
names. It also has to determine receiver and class objects as well
as argument types. (De)serialization [ 22 ] writes or reads Java objects from a stream of bytes, e.g., a file. For (de)serialization, the
JVM invokes special methods, e.g., `readResolve`, that must be handled by the call-graph analysis. To resolve a call on a deserialized
object, a call-graph analysis also needs to determine the types
of objects in the byte stream. Threads are started by calling the
built-in `Thread.start` method, which leads to the JVM invoking
`Thread.run` ; hence, it requires specific handling by call-graph algorithms. What complicates the problem further is that these features
can be used in combination, e.g., threads may start `Runnable` objects loaded via reflection.
Advanced features induce unique challenges for different callgraph algorithms—hence, each call-graph analysis typically treats
them specifically. For example, reflection is easier to handle by
call-graph algorithms that have allocation information and deserialization is easier for imprecise algorithms that over-approximate
the possible classes deserialized.



Handling language features differently creates coupling between
call resolution of features and the base call-graph algorithms and
violates separation of concerns. For example, WALA’s CHA does
not use the call-graph-builder facilities of RTA and CFA but its
own, redundant implementation of some features. Thus, WALA’s
RTA algorithm handles static initializers differently from WALA’s
CHA—with RTA, they should be deemed reachable only for classes
actually instantiated. In Soot, the call-resolution code for RTA and
Spark is strongly coupled to the call-graph builder class, which not
only resolves standard calls, but is also responsible for recognizing
reflection. Supporting new language features would thus require
changing the call-graph builder class. Both Soot and Wala resolve
only explicit calls. Features that are not explicit calls such as static
initializers do not use the same call-resolution facilities.

One might argue that this is only the result of missing care in
the implementation and that more implementation effort could fix
these inconsistencies. While true, without shared language feature
support, this places a lot of burden onto developers of the callgraph analyses, both in terms of care and implementation effort to
maintain feature support individually for different algorithms, and
feature support can again diverge over time.


Problem 2: Different Type Information. Different call-graph algorithms require different type information to resolve virtual calls. For
example, CHA requires only the declared types, RTA additionally
requires information about the classes that are instantiated anywhere in the program, and CFA requires the precise information
produced by a pointer analysis.
These different representations typically require calls to be resolved specifically for each call-graph algorithm. An implementation for call resolution for CHA is not compatible with RTA and
vice-versa because the code to retrieve subtypes from the class
hierarchy is different from code to retrieve suitable types from a
global type set. This is especially true if the global type set for
RTA is constructed on the fly during call-graph construction, i.e., it
constantly changes, while type-hierarchy information is constant.
The same problem holds for CHA and CFA or RTA and CFA—in
fact, for any two call-graph algorithms.
A potential solution is to adopt a single representation for type
information for all algorithms—typically, a points-to representation.
For instance, Soot and WALA do not directly implement RTA, but
emulate it by means of a points-to analysis. This strategy is, however, inefficient for algorithms that do not require such an intricate
representation. Our validation (Section 4) of RTA in both Soot and
WALA confirms this. Using a single representation also closely couples the resolution of calls to the computation of type information,
exchanging the single representation for a different one, or one
using a different algorithm is not easily done in WALA or Soot. The
declarative framework Doop [ 3 ] also uses a single representation,
computing points-to information using Datalog queries. Unlike
WALA or Soot, Doop only supports algorithms of the CFA family,
and it is unclear whether or how efficiently supporting algorithms
like CHA or RTA could be implemented in Doop while reusing its
call-resolution Datalog queries that use points-to information.


Summary of Problems. Together, the outlined problems make it
difficult to support language features across multiple call-graph
algorithms, thus complicating call-graph implementation. Complex

Figure 2: Interaction of components


code for resolving language features needs to be re-implemented
over and over for different base algorithms, and different kinds of
type information need to be handled in implementing resolution
code. Ultimately this leads to soundness inconsistencies (Table 1).
For instance, soundness with regard to static initializers differs
between WALA’s CHA and RTA in an unexpected way. WALA’s
RTA algorithm is in many cases more sound than WALA’s CHA.
This is surprising because the less precise CHA should theoretically
be more sound.


Our Solution in a Nutshell. To address the problems, we decouple the call resolution of special language features from the base
call-graph algorithm and capture them in independent call-resolver
modules. To enable this decoupling, we introduce the type iterator, an abstraction layer that retrieves and interprets the different
type representations produced by different base algorithms (type
producers). This way, call resolvers for individual language features
can be implemented only once, by using the type iterator as a unified interface to access type information. Thus, they use the most
precise available type information, while being independent of its
internal representation or computation. Individual call resolvers are
decoupled from each other and agnostic of the call-graph algorithm.
They can be plugged into call-graph algorithms without changes
to existing code.
Our approach addresses problem 1 by having the decoupled
call resolvers collaborate to resolve calls for different language
features. It addresses problem 2 by having type information be
kept in the most efficient representation for each individual base
algorithm. We show that this approach leads to more consistent
soundness. Furthermore, it improves the maintainability of callgraph algorithms, as one can easily add, reuse, or exchange call
resolvers to tune precision and performance.


3 UNIMOCG MODULAR ARCHITECTURE


We start with an overview of Unimocg’s components. We then
describe individual components in detail and discuss how they
collaborate despite being decoupled.


3.1 Architectural Overview


Unimocg consists of four types of components (Fig. 1): Type producers analyze the code to compute the possible runtime types of local
variables and fields. A type iterator provides a unified view on this



information for other components to use. Call resolvers use type
information through the type iterator to resolve method calls that
result from different language features. Finally, type consumers are
further analyses that use type information but do not resolve calls.
Components are decoupled from each other using interfaces
and communicate indirectly via a central data store; a fixed-point
solver integrated therein serves as an intermediary. To bootstrap the
process, the store is initialized with a set of entry-point contexts [3],
e.g., the analyzed program’s main method(s).

Fig. 2 depicts how components interact: Whenever a new reachable context is discovered, the solver triggers type producers and
call resolvers (a). Type producers process the new context and
return new type information to the data store (b). Call resolvers
analyze the new context and request data from the type iterator (c);
the latter forwards the request to the store (d), which returns to the
type iterator whatever type information is currently available (e).
The type iterator interprets the information and forwards the result
to call resolvers (f). Also, if step (b) found additional information,
the data store notifies the type iterator to forward this information
to call resolvers and type consumers that requested it earlier (e &
f). Finally, call resolvers add new edges to the call graph (g), which
may reveal more reachable contexts and the cycle repeats. When
no new edges or type information are found anymore, the analysis
reached a fixed point and terminates. Note that edges are never
changed or removed from the store, thus termination is guaranteed.


3.2 Type Producers


Type producers compute type information required by other components. For instance, a type producer for an RTA call graph calculates which classes the program instantiates, while a type producer for a CFA call graph computes points-to information of
local variables. A call graph may also use multiple type producers, e.g., we may split the points-to type producer for CFA into
multiple modules, each handling different language features, e.g.,
`java.lang.System.arraycopy` . A call graph may not need any
type producer, e.g, a CHA algorithm can compute type information
directly from the class hierarchy without a dedicated type producer.
Type producers represent type information in an algorithmspecific way. For example, an RTA type producer represents its
type information as a global type set, while different CFA type producers for different language features represent their information as
points-to sets and set union is used to combine their results. Some
algorithms like 푘-푙-CFA with 푙 ≥ 1 additionally provide allocation
data, while other type producers cannot provide such information. Allocation data may be needed by specific call resolvers and
type consumers, e.g., resolving a reflective call of `Method.invoke`
requires knowledge about the particular `Method` object involved.
Despite employing algorithm-specific representations, type producers implement a common interface (shared with call resolvers).
Listing 1 shows pseudocode for this interface. Global singletons are
used to retrieve `dataStore` and `typeIterator`, the actual analysis
is defined in method `analyze` . Different type producers implement
`analyze` in specific ways. It is executed once for each context `ctx`
found reachable and computes the respective type information.


3 A context is the (context-sensitive) abstraction of a method invocation [14]

target.class)
7 dataStore.add((context, local), PointsTo, newObject)
8 [...]


Listing 2: Points-To Type Producer (Excerpt showing pointsto data creation on constructor invocations)


Type producers are agnostic of how calls are resolved. They are
triggered by the store for all reachable contexts, regardless of how
the latter are computed. We illustrate this in Listing 2: It shows an
excerpt of the points-to type producer’s `analyze` method where
points-to objects are created whenever the analysis of the current
context method finds a call whose target is a constructor. The type
producer uses only the information in the `callTargets` that are
retrieved from the data store, the implementation is agnostic of the
call resolver that found the target. In particular, the constructor invocation could be the result of reflection (e.g., `Class.newInstance` )
or of deserialization instead of a direct call.


3.3 Type Iterator


Type iterators implement the iterator pattern [ 8 ] to allow retrieving
and iterating over information on the possible runtime types of a
local variable or a field from the data store in a uniform way. Type
iterators and type producers go hand in hand (e.g., the RTA type
iterator requires an RTA instantiated-types analysis to be executed),
except for CHA where type iteration happens on the fly.
Despite their close relation, we separate type producers from
type iterators for two reasons: First, one can have different type
iterators provide different views on the type information of a single
producer. For example, we can have different iterators for a single
points-to type producer, each for different context sensitivities. Second, a single type iterator can provide an aggregated view over the
information produced by multiple type producers. For example, a
single type iterator for some given context sensitivity can aggregate
the information of several points-to type producers—a basic one
for local variables, etc. and additional ones for advanced features,
e.g., native methods or reflection.
We abstract over specific type iterators with a unified interface
`TypeIterator` . Listing 3 shows the methods that operate on local
variables; analogous methods that operate on fields are omitted
for brevity. The generic type `Context` specifies the type of context
used, e.g., call strings. Methods `foreachType` and `foreachAlloc`

handleType: Type −> ())

Listing 3: Type Iterator Interface


iterate over types and allocations for a local variable `var` in a certain context `ctx` . The interface also defines two methods for iterating on incremental updates of the type data, which we omit for
brevity. `newContext` returns a new context based on a method and
`expandContext` extends an existing context `old` as necessary for
context-sensitive analyses like 푘-푙-CFA. This enables type producers to support different types of context. Call resolvers on the other
hand are oblivious to the type of context and treat it as a method.
Unimocg includes type iterators for CHA, RTA, XTA, MTA, FTA,
CTA, 0-CFA, 1-0-CFA, 0-1-CFA, and 1-1-CFA. In the following, we
discuss three exemplary iterator instances, shown in Listing 4, for
CHA, RTA, and CFA, to show how they retrieve type information
from the data store and how they make it available to call resolvers
and type consumers. We do not discuss the remaining iterators, but
Unimocg is available under an open-source BSD 2-clause license as
part of the OPAL framework. [4]

The CHA type iterator does not need data from the store as the
class hierarchy is computed a priori. Hence, method `foreachType`
simply iterates over all subtypes of the variable’s declared type. The
RTA iterator resolves the variable’s types based on which types
may be instantiated. It retrieves the global set of instantiated types
from the central data store, then filters this set to only the subtypes
of the variable’s declared type; finally, it iterates over these types.
The 푘 -CFA type iterator resolves the variable’s types based on contextual points-to information using a 푘 -truncated call context [ 23 ]
(line 29). Given such a call context, the methods `foreachType` and
`foreachAlloc` retrieve the set of allocation sites from a context
sensitive points-to analysis from the data store and iterate over
only the respective types, respectively all allocation sites.


3.4 Call Resolvers


Call resolvers use information obtained from type iterators to resolve call sites to possible target contexts. Like type producers, they
implement the interface in Listing 1. For illustration, we discuss
two call resolvers of different complexity.

Listing 5 shows how the call resolver for regular calls uses the
type iterator to resolve virtual method calls: After the `analyze`
method found a virtual method call `call`, it iterates over all possible
runtime types of the receiver object (Line 3). Once the types are
known, resolving the call to a callee method (Line 4), creating a
target context for the callee (Line 5) and the call edge (Line 6),
and adding it to the call graph (Line 7) are standard steps in all
call-resolution code.

Listing 5: Basic Call Resolver (Excerpt showing resolution of

In Listing 6, we show an excerpt of the reflection call resolver’s
`analyze` method. It is more complex, but also directly uses the type
iterator: When the reflection resolver finds a call, it checks whether
this is a `Method.invoke` call ( Lines 2-3 ). It takes this information
from the global store, no matter which call resolver found that call
edge. For calls to `Method.invoke`, the resolver gathers information about the receiver and parameters of the reflectively invoked
method ( Lines 4-5 ); this step (method `getObjects`, which is not

12 })
13 [...]


Listing 6: Reflection Call Resolver (Excerpt showing
resolution of **`Method.invoke`** )


shown here) uses the type iterator’s `foreachAlloc` . The reflection
resolver then iterates over the possible `Method` objects, as they
encode which method can be invoked (Line 7). As in regular virtualcall resolution, the final steps are finding possible target methods
(Line 8) and adding a corresponding call edge to the store (Line 11). [5]

As Line 7 shows, allocation data is used to resolve reflection. Where
type producers do not provide such data, like for CHA or RTA, the
type iterator instead iterates over intra-procedural allocation sites
from def-use information and signifies if this is incomplete.
Call resolvers are decoupled from each other (and from type producers) via the data store. Yet, they collaboratively compute the call
graph. The information contained in the call edge in Line 10 on the
receiver and the parameters is made available to other call resolvers
and type producers through the store. E.g., in Lines 4-6, we get this
data from the individual `target` call edge, not from the `call` in
the analyzed code. This is important to allow resolution of chained
indirect invocations. For instance, if the `Method` object represented
`Method.invoke` and `receivers` contained further `Method` objects,
this chained invocation still can be resolved by the code in Listing 6.
Multiple call resolvers that cover different language features,
e.g., virtual calls, reflection, threads, or serialization, collaboratively
construct the call graph. By combining a set of call resolvers, one
can configure the soundness of a call graph. Individual resolvers
are reusable across different algorithms because they only depend
on the common interface of type iterators. As a result, it is easy to
ensure consistent feature handling across different algorithms.


3.5 Type Consumers


Type information is useful for a range of analyses beyond call-graph
construction. For instance, to determine the immutability of a field
`f`, an immutability analysis may use the types of objects that `f` could
refer to [ 20 ]. We model such analyses as so-called type consumers.
They access type information through the type iterator interface,
which decouples them from the call-graph algorithm that produces


5 Finding target methods uses a simple analysis of constant strings aided by Unimocg
providing access to allocation sites. A more sophisticated string analysis can be implemented as a type consumer and used instead for improved soundness and precision.



56


Unimocg: Modular Call-Graph Algorithms for Consistent Handling of Language Features ISSTA ’24, September 16–20, 2024, Vienna, Austria



this information. This allows to easily change the call-graph algorithm without modifying the type-consumer analyses; by doing so,
we can fine-tune the precision and performance of type consumers.
As such, they are conceptually the same as call resolvers, but they
do not (directly) participate in call-graph construction, so we discuss them separately. As type consumers depend on the single type
iterator, they consider type information with exactly the precision
of the chosen iterator. This ensures that all type consumers operate
on a consistent level of soundness, precision, and performance. In
contrast, different parts of a monolithic analysis may use varying
levels of hard-coded precision, hindering a systematic exploration
of precision, soundness, and performance trade-offs.


4 VALIDATION


We implemented the architecture presented in the previous section
in the OPAL framework [ 6, 10 ]. Our implementation is available
open source under a BSD 2-clause license. [6] OPAL’s blackboard
architecture with its fixed-point solver [ 10 ] serves as the central
data store of Unimocg and enables analysis modules to collaborate
while being fully decoupled. The Unimocg architecture is, however,
framework-independent and can be instantiated on top of any
interaction infrastructure that supports decoupled components to
collaborate. We use the OPAL-based implementation to empirically
validate our claims by examining the following research questions:


RQ1 Does Unimocg enable deriving families of call graphs from
reusable modules?

RQ2 Do the resulting call graphs exhibit consistent soundness?
RQ3 What is the impact of Unimocg’s modular architecture and
increased soundness on precision and performance?
RQ4 What is the impact of Unimocg on type consumers?


All measurements were performed in a Docker container that is
provided as an artifact.


4.1 Deriving Call-Graph Families


To answer RQ1, we implemented various type producers, type
iterators, and call resolvers and used them to derive ten different
call-graph algorithms.
The implemented type producers are: (i) a global instantiatedtypes analysis, (ii) a parameterized propagation-based instantiatedtypes analysis, (iii) a parameterized points-to analysis augmented
by type producers for Java APIs that require special handling, e.g.,
`java.lang.System.arraycopy` and `sun.misc.Unsafe` .
The implemented type iterators are: (i) CHA and RTA iterators
from Listing 4, (ii) an iterator that is parameterized to support the
propagation-based algorithms XTA, MTA, FTA, and CTA [ 29 ], (iii)
traits for different context sensitivities and points-to set representations of 푘-푙-CFA call graphs.
The implemented call resolvers are: (i) a virtual and non-virtual
call resolver, (ii) call resolvers for reflection, serialization, threads,
static initializers, finalizers, the `doPrivileged` API provided by
the class `java.security.AccessController`, and a number of
important native methods from the JDK’s class library, (iii) an
alternative call-resolver for reflection that uses information from
the dynamic analysis Tamiflex [2].


6 [https://www.opal-project.de](https://www.opal-project.de)



Combining these type producers, type iterators, and call resolvers, we derived ten different call-graph algorithms: CHA, RTA,
XTA, MTA, FTA, CTA, 0-CFA, 0-1-CFA, 1-0-CFA, and 1-1-CFA. For
CHA, we used the CHA iterator without a type producer, as it
solely depends on the precomputed class-hierarchy type information. To derive RTA, we combined the RTA iterator with the global
instantiated-types type producer. For XTA, MTA, FTA, and CTA,
we combined the respective iterators with the propagation-based
instantiated-types type producer. Lastly, to derive the CFA variants, we combined the respective CFA type-iterator traits with the
points-to type producers. Importantly, we could reuse the same
call resolvers across all algorithms although the type information
produced differs and call resolvers need different information.
Due to the abstraction that is the common type iterator interface,
we can easily derive a family of call-graph algorithms with varying
levels of precision and performance. By selecting an appropriate
type iterator and corresponding type producer(s), users select the
precision of type information to be computed, i.e., the precision of
the call graph. The selection of call resolvers for language features
is orthogonal to the selection of type iterators and type producers.
This makes it easy for analysis developers to add new algorithms (as
a combination of type iterator and type producer) or call resolvers
for new features and reuse all existing components with them.


 - Unimocg enables deriving families of different call graphs by
modularly composing individual components.

 - All call resolvers are reusable across all algorithms.


4.2 Soundness Consistency


To answer RQ2, we executed the benchmark of Reif et al. [ 16 ] on
five of Unimocg’s algorithms—CHA, RTA, XTA, 0-CFA, 1-1-CFA —
representative for the different families of algorithms; other algorithms from these families (e.g., MTA instead of XTA) show similar
results. Reif et al.’s benchmark measures missing edges (false negatives) caused by insufficient support of individual language features.
We used this instead of measuring recall on real-world applications,
as there is no suitable ground truth for recall on real-world applications. Also, this would only provide a global view on false negatives,
i.e., the overall number of missing call-graph edges independent of
language features; thus, we would not be able to answer if Unimocg
improves consistency of language feature support.

Table 2 shows the results: Unimocg’s call-graph algorithms exhibit high and consistent language feature support. They soundly
pass between 79% and 81% of all test cases. In contrast, WALA
and Soot pass between 41% and 53% of test cases (Table 1). Consistent feature support in Unimocg is due to its call-graph algorithms
sharing the same call resolvers.
Whereas in Soot and WALA, there is a difference in soundness
of 12 percentage points (pp), Unimocg shows now such differences.
Except for 1-1-CFA, its algorithms show the identical soundness
profile and are fully consistent with each other. The 2 pp difference
for 1-1-CFA is easily explained: 1-1-CFA has access to interprocedural allocation site information, which allows it to more soundly and
precisely resolve reflection. Remaining unsoundness in Unimocg
is the result of not yet implemented call resolvers. Currently, we
still lack resolvers for class loading and dynamic proxies, complex
features not supported by WALA or Soot either. Once respective

call resolvers are implemented, they can be used consistently for all
algorithms. To sum up, the sources of unsoundness in Unimocg are
explainable and resolving them only requires further engineering
effort, but no changes to existing call resolvers.


 - Unimocg shows consistently high soundness compared to other
frameworks. This is the result of reusing the same call-resolver
modules across all call-graph algorithms.


4.3 Impact on Precision and Performance


Looking only at test cases passed could lead to incorrect conclusions if test cases were passed only due to excessive imprecision
or come at a significant performance cost. Thus, we show that
Unimocg’s consistent soundness does not compromise precision
or performance (RQ3). To this end, we compare three different
call-graph algorithms: CHA, RTA, and 0-CFA. These algorithms
are available in all frameworks being compared, Unimocg, Soot,
and WALA (0-CFA only for WALA and Unimocg). We run the subject algorithms on five Java applications from XCorpus [ 5 ], which
were also used by Reif et al. [ 16 ]. We used the Adoptium OpenJDK 1.8.0_342-b07 that worked with all frameworks. The different
frameworks by default exclude different parts of the JDK from the
analysis, thus, we configured all frameworks to analyze the full JDK
for comparability. Soot’s RTA, however, can not analyze the full
JDK 8 as that contains MethodHandle constants that Soot’s RTA is
not prepared to handle (Soot’s SPARK has the same problem). We
thus ran Soot RTA with its default configuration excluding large
parts of the JDK. The results are shown in Table 3.
Precision. Following common methodology [ 25, 29 ], we measure
precision by counting the number of reachable methods—more
precise call graphs have fewer reachable methods.
Unimocg’s call-graph algorithms do not suffer precision degradation compared to Soot’s and WALA’s. Unimocg’s CHA is comparable to both Soot’s and WALA’s ( ∼ 5% and ∼ 18% more methods,
respectively). Soot’s RTA, even though excluding large parts of
the JDK, has on average 1.7x and WALA’s has 7x the reachable



methods of Unimocg’s RTA. WALA’s CFA has on average 2x the
reachable methods of Unimocg’s. While precision across different frameworks differs significantly and is difficult to compare
precisely, the numbers clearly indicate that Unimocg’s algorithms
do not suffer from systematic imprecision, on the contrary. This
is explainable: modularity helps not only to cover more features
orthogonally, increasing soundness; it also makes it easier to implement more precise call resolution because call resolvers make
use of the precise type information provided by type producers.
Also note that for Unimocg, the number of reachable methods
decreases significantly when we use more precise type producers; e.g., its RTA identifies around 90% fewer reachable methods
than its CHA. This matches the expectations of call-graph users and
shows that reusing the same call-resolver modules across call-graph
algorithms does not impair their relative precision. Specifically, individual call resolvers use the type information gathered by the
chosen type producer and thus work at a consistent level of precision. This is not possible if the computation of type information is
tightly coupled to the resolution of virtual calls; in this case, modules for other language features would rely on a fixed, potentially
ad-hoc, method of computing type information.
Performance. Table 3 reports analysis runtime in seconds as median of 3 executions on a server with two AMD(R) EPYC(R) 7542
@ 2.90 GHz (32 cores / 64 threads each) CPUs and 512 GB RAM.
Unimocg’s call-graph algorithms do not suffer performance
degradation, either. The most notable finding is the difference in
RTA performance. Unimocg’s RTA is on average 14x and 35x faster
than RTA of Soot (again, excluding large parts of the JDK), resp.
WALA. This is noteworthy because to enable reusing call-graph
modules, e.g., for the one resolving reflection, Soot and WALA emulate RTA by a points-to analysis. Our evaluation indicates that
this approach seems to come at a significant performance cost. Unimocg’s 0-CFA is 2.4x slower than WALA’s 0-CFA across applications
in the benchmark except jext, on which WALA’s 0-CFA took over
36 minutes and Unimocg only took 86 seconds. Unimocg’s CHA is
5x slower than WALA’s, but 6x faster than Soot’s. We attribute this
to OPAL’s intermediate representation, which employs abstract
interpretation [ 18 ] to provide refined type information but needs
more computation time per reachable method; Soot’s Jimple [ 31 ],
while not based on abstract interpretation, offers similar information. Note that performance differences between frameworks may
be due to implementation details beyond our proposed architecture.
Thus, this experiment cannot be used to draw conclusions about absolute performance, only show that Unimocg does not compromise
performance because of its modularity.
We conclude that Unimocg’s modular architecture does not compromise performance. This is explainable: the main indirection we
add to OPAL is cheap—two method calls on the type-iterator object.


 - Unimocg’s modular architecture does not compromise on precision
or performance; this is indicated by the comparison to state-of-theart frameworks and consistent relative precision across algorithms.

 - Crucially, Unimocg enables reuse of modules across different algorithms without relying on inefficient emulation; this benefit is
indicated by Unimocg significantly outperforming Soot and WALA’s
RTA implementations, which are emulated by points-to algorithms.

4.4 Impact on Type Consumers

To answer RQ4, we performed a case study with OPAL’s field immutability analysis [ 20 ]. It analyzes whether a field can be modified
or is guaranteed to be immutable. In particular, this depends on
whether the types of objects stored in the field are immutable.
We first studied OPAL’s field immutability analysis to find out
that it relied on the declared type of a field (i.e., it has CHA precision) plus additional ad-hoc precision improvements (we refer to
this as ad-hoc CHA). Next, we implemented a new version of that
analysis using Unimocg’s type iterator interface. Our hypothesis
is that the field immutability analysis benefits directly from using
the type iterator in terms of both improved precision and reduced
code size. Precision of the immutability analysis depends on precise
type information, because `final` fields are either transitively immutable, if they can only refer to immutable objects, or otherwise
non-transitively immutable, if that is not the case; dependent immutability (for fields with generic types) is located between these
two levels. More precise type information thus allows to assign the
more precise value transitively immutable to more fields. Code size
is expected to be reduced because the immutability analysis does
not need to implement (ad-hoc) logic for inferring type information.
We compare the ad-hoc CHA implementation by Roth et al. [ 20 ]
with the Unimocg-based implementation using different call-graph
algorithms. Previously, such an exploration of different call-graph
algorithms would not have been possible as the precision was hardcoded into the analysis (ad-hoc CHA). We analyze the OpenJDK
1.8.0_342-b07 used in the previous section as OpenJDK 1.8 was also
the primary evaluation target of the original implementation [20].

Table 4 shows the results concerning precision, clearly showing
that using more precise call-graph algorithms (in particular, more
precise type information) significantly improves the precision of the
immutability analysis implemented as a Unimocg type consumer.
For instance, using the RTA type iterator results in 17 604 more
fields, i.e., 18.8% of all fields, found to be transitively immutable
compared to CHA. Using XTA further improved the precision,
with 4481 more transitively immutable fields compared to RTA.
The CHA type iterator results in less precision than the baseline,
because of the removed ad-hoc logic of the baseline for improving
precision upon CHA. Yet, (a) the precision reduction is small (0.9%
of all fields get a less precise result), and (b) one could avoid even

this small imprecision (at the cost of some performance) by using
Unimocg’s foreachAlloc method instead without adding complexity
to the implementation of the immutability analysis.
Moreover, by implementing the field immutability analysis as
a Unimocg type consumer, we could replace the baseline’s ad-hoc
CHA logic (95 lines of code, or 20% of the total size of the field
immutability analysis) by 26 LOCs for using the type iterator, while
achieving higher precision and enabling experimentation with different call-graph algorithms. The positive effect on code quality
is more pronounced than the mere numbers may suggest: The removed code was complex and a clear violation of the principle of
separation of concerns, as it was not concerned with the actual task
of analyzing immutability. Using Unimocg, duplication of functionality is reduced and separation of concerns is re-established.


 - Implementing the field immutability analysis as a type consumer
improved it compared to an ad-hoc implementation.

 - Its precision is always consistent with the chosen call-graph algorithm and directly benefits from more precise call-graph algorithms.

 - It is less complex and has a better separation of concerns.


4.5 Threats to Validity


Our choice of Soot and WALA to compare against may be perceived
as a threat to the validity of our results. One may wonder about
other frameworks like Doop [ 3 ] or the many compilers that internally compute call graphs. Soot and WALA represent, however, the
state of the art in static analysis frameworks and offer a variety of
different call-graph algorithms. Unlike them, Doop focuses on a single family of call graphs based on CFA whereas Unimocg provides
consistent soundness across call-graph algorithms from different
families. Thus, it is easy for Doop to provide a single representation
of type information and reuse call-resolution code, which is not the

case if dissimilar families of call-graph algorithms are to be supported. Compilers usually use a single call-graph implementation
that is tailored to be strictly sound but does not have to consider
details of complex language features, such as reflection.
Our use of the benchmark by Reif et al. could also introduce
a bias in the considered features. However, it is the only suitable
benchmark available to compare call-graph soundness and it has
been carefully crafted to extensively cover the relevant features for
call-graph construction on the Java Virtual Machine.


5 RELATED WORK


In this section, we present related work regarding call-graph construction. We discuss general-purpose analysis frameworks and
families of call-graph algorithms. Finally, we present related work
about supporting complex language features in call-graph algorithms and measuring soundness w.r.t. such features.


5.1 Analysis Frameworks


OPAL [ 10 ] previously supported RTA with a high level of soundness [ 16 ]. While language features were supported by individual
modules, they were not built to interpret different kinds of type
information. Thus, they had a fixed level of precision and could not
be reused for consistent soundness with other call-graph algorithms
such as CFA. They also used ad-hoc methods of computing local
allocation information to improve soundness and precision. OPAL’s
immutability analysis [ 20 ] also relied on such ad-hoc methods that
are not needed with Unimocg.
Soot [ 30 ] supports different call-graph algorithms such as CHA,
RTA, and VTA (Variable Type Analysis [ 28 ]). While CHA is implemented directly, other call-graph algorithms such as RTA and VTA
are emulated in the points-to framework SPARK [ 13 ]. This allows
them to reuse call-resolution code across different algorithms. However, the emulation of less precise algorithms such as RTA comes
at the cost of performance as we show in our evaluation (Table 3).
The Watson Libraries for Analysis (WALA) [ 11 ] also support different call-graph algorithms like CHA, RTA, and CFA. WALA decouples the creation of call graphs from the call resolution for language
features with the Java interfaces called call-graph builder and context interpreter. In particular, a call-graph builder computes a call
graph with RTA or CFA precision, whereas a context interpreter
resolves calls of built-in language features such as reflection. Crucially, unlike Unimocg, WALA does not decouple the analysis of
type information. For example, the RTA call-graph builder is closely
coupled to a points-to analysis to determine the instantiated classes.
Also, the RTA call-graph builder implements special handling of
the `clone` method and in this is strongly coupled to an interpreter
for that feature. As context interpreters are only invoked on explicit
call instructions, features such as static initialization that happen
regardless of explicit calls cannot be handled. WALA’s CHA implementation does not use the call-graph-builder facilities and has its
own redundant implementation of some features such as invocation
of static class initializers. In contrast, Unimocg decouples these concerns, leading to more consistent soundness. WALA’s architecture
for call-graph construction is not extensively documented and has
not been discussed in a scientific publication so far.



The Doop framework [ 3 ] also supports points-to based call-graph
algorithms. Based on Datalog, it includes rule sets for language
features such as reflection. These rule sets are modularly shared between call graphs of different context sensitivity. However, popular
algorithms such as CHA and RTA are not feasible with Doop: even
if they were implemented using Datalog rule sets, they would need
all type information for every local variable to be stored individually like in points-to based solutions in order for other rule sets like
the base call graph and reflection to use them. This would result
in high memory use, offsetting the benefits of simpler call-graph
algorithms. Unimocg, in contrast, provides just an interface to access the type information computed anyway. For RTA, e.g., type
information for a local variable is provided directly from a single set
of all classes instantiated in the program. Thus, type information is
stored only once, keeping memory requirements minimal.
None of the frameworks discussed here decouples the computation of type information from call resolution for dissimilar families
of call-graph algorithms. In contrast, Unimocgprovides a unified
interface to type information to be used by any call resolution code
for any call-graph algorithm. This unified interface can additionally
be used by analyses beyond call-graph construction.


5.2 Families of Call-Graph Algorithms


Class-hierarchy analysis [ 4 ] (CHA) is the simplest type-based callgraph algorithm as its call resolution depends solely on the statically
declared type of the call’s receiver. Bacon and Sweeney’s rapid-type
analysis [ 1 ] (RTA) improves over CHA by only considering subtypes
that are instantiated by the analyzed program. However, these
algorithms solely describe the resolution of standard virtual calls,
neglecting other aspects, such as language features like reflection,
which additionally affect call-graph construction.
Tip and Palsberg [ 29 ] propose a propagation-based call-graph
framework, introducing four call-graph algorithms: CTA, FTA,
MTA, and XTA. They attribute a call graph’s precision to the number of sets used to approximate run-time values of expressions. CTA
uses distinct sets for classes, MTA uses distinct sets for classes and
fields, FTA uses distinct sets for classes and methods, and XTA uses
distinct sets for fields and methods. Thus, the framework allows to
instantiate various context-insensitive call-graph algorithms. However, the authors only discuss and evaluate standard virtual-call
resolution. It remains unclear whether sharing additional modules
to support other language features is generically possible.
Grove and Chambers [ 9 ] give a visualization of the relative precision and computation cost of the previously discussed and further
call-graph algorithms. Moreover, they present a framework for callgraph algorithms that is parametric in the choice of context sensitivity. They distinguish three contour selection functions to allow
varying levels of context sensitivity. Here, a contour denotes each
context-sensitive version of a procedure. These functions enabled
them to extend Shivers’ 푘 -CFA [ 23 ] to the more precise 푘 - 푙 -CFA
algorithm. Thus, the framework allows for a single implementation for a range of points-to-based call-graph algorithms. However,
their framework is not applicable to commonly used highly scalable
algorithms such as CHA and RTA. Furthermore, forms of context
sensitivity are restricted by the signatures of the four contour key
selection functions for procedures, instance variables, classes, and

the environment (the latter being necessary for nested closures).
Finally, their framework again only considers standard virtual-call
resolution, but not how to combine this with additional modules to
support various language features necessary for sound call graphs.


5.3 Feature Support And Soundness


In addition to the resolution of virtual method calls, a call graph
highly depends on how other aspects, such as language features
or APIs, are taken into account during call-graph construction.
In recent years, researchers proposed approaches to specifically
support language features and APIs such as reflection [ 15 ], dynamic
proxies [ 7 ], serialization [ 21 ] or even new language instructions. For
example, Fourtounis et al. [ 7 ] discussed how to add support for a the
invokedynamic Java bytecode instruction introduced in Java which
provides a new call instruction with user-defined semantics [ 19 ],
which is highly-relevant to call-graph construction. Unfortunately,
all of them are presented and evaluated in the context of specific
call-graph algorithms, lacking comprehensive discussion how to
generalize these concepts to other algorithms.
While researching these individual concepts is crucial to obtain
sound and precise call graphs, it does not imply that they are implemented in commonly used call-graph frameworks. Sui et al. [ 26 ]
compared call graphs generated by Soot, WALA, and Doop and
measured their differences in soundness. Finding unsoundness, they
investigated its root causes in follow up work [ 27 ]. Comparing static
call graphs and dynamically recorded context call trees, they find
that advanced language features, such as reflection, serialization,
or native methods, are significant reasons for unsoundness.
Reif et al. [ 16, 17 ] investigated the feature support of various
call-graph algorithms from Soot, WALA, Doop, and OPAL using a
hand-crafted test suite. Their test suite consists of test cases, each
testing whether a particular call-graph algorithm supports a specific
Java language feature or API. As a result, they found that even call
graphs from the same framework support different feature sets.
These studies show the need for modular call-graph construction
that supports not only implementing call graphs with different
precision and scalability trade-offs, but also to implement generic
feature support among different algorithms as we do with Unimocg.


6 CONCLUSION


We have shown that modular call-graph construction that decouples the computation of types of local variables from the resolution
of call targets is sorely needed. This decoupling enables modular
composition of different analyses that contribute to both type computation and call resolution, making it possible to model different
language features and APIs in individual modules. With individual
modules, feature support can be implemented and reasoned about
in isolation. This is necessary to facilitate support for a multitude
of such features that are relevant to call-graph construction. As a
result, users of call graphs can rely on consistent feature support
and analysis developers can easily add new algorithms or language
features while reusing existing components.
We presented our modular architecture, Unimocg, that achieves
this decoupling through a unified interface, the type iterator, that
can be queried by call-resolver modules to get type information



from type-producer modules. This allows all call resolvers to collaborate despite being fully independent of each other. Further
analyses that need type information, such as immutability analyses,
can benefit from this unified interface as well. With its modular
architecture, Unimocg already supports ten different call-graph algorithms from vastly different families: CHA, RTA, the XTA family
including MTA, FTA, and CTA, and four 푘 - 푙 -CFA-based algorithms.
Our evaluation shows that Unimocg can provide consistently
high soundness across different call-graph algorithms that span a
wide range of precision, an important improvement over the state
of the art. The consistently high soundness does not come at the
price of sacrificing precision or performance. We also showed how
Unimocg’s unified interface can be used to improve the precision
of an immutability analysis while simplifying its implementation.
While we discussed call-graph construction for JVM-based languages here, similar issues apply to other programming languages
as well and Unimocg’s architecture is not specific to the JVM, but
can be used for call graphs in any language.
